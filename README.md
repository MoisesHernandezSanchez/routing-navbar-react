# Routing Navbar React
Created a demonstration of how to create a navbar using React that: 
- routes to different pages of the site without refreshing using React Router
- Highlights the active page in the navbar

Makes it simpler to add additional pages by creating a react component in the pages folder and adding it as a Route in the App.js as well as making a CustomLink in the Navbar.js
